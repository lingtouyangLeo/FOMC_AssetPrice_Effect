Good afternoon . My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people . The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years . Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings . I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments . Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at asolid pace . For 2024 as awhole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer spending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter but was strong for the year overall . Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized . In the labor market, conditions remain solid . Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the past three months . Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has stabilized since the middle of last year and , at 4.1 percent in December, remains low . Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed . Overall, awide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance . The labor market is not asource of significant inflationary pressures . Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent . Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in abroad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets . Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people . We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate . Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by afull percentage point from its peak . That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market . With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in ahurry to adjust our policy stance . At today ’smeeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal fund srate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent . We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation . At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment . In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks . We’re not on any preset course . As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in amanner that best promotes our maximum- employment and price -stability goals . If the economy remains —economy maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate . As we previously announced, our five -year review , review of our monetary policy framework is taking place this year . At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews . Our review will again include outreach and public events involving awide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and aresearch conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings . We intend to wrap up the review by late summer . I would note that the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be afocus of the review . The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy : maximum employment and stable prices . We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -run inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country . Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .
