Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time. Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second- quarter level. The reopening of the economy led to arapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been str ong and has moved above its pre -pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes , in part , to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interes trates. Business investment has also picked up. Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic , and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left asignificant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting arise in durable goods prices. However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraor dinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check. The recent rise in new COVID -19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning. All of us have arole to play in our nati on’sresponse to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’ ssafe to reengage in abroad range of activities. The Federal Reserve’sresponse to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people , along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad -based and inclusive having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we said in September and again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’sassessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exc eed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace. These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. At this meeting, my colleagues and I discusse dour asset purchases and the role they are playing in supporting the recovery. At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at asubstantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency MBS. We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve financial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum - The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad an dforceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting arobust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury D epartment and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as abacks top to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But for many others , getting aloan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as asociety, should direct our collective resources. The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made acritical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity I’dlike to mention acouple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary of Economic Projections beginning in December. First, we will release the entire package of SEP materials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out. Previously, some of these materials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes. This step will make more information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions of forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections. Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time. These changes to the SEP will provide atimely perspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections, thereby highlighting some of the risk- management considerations that are relevant for monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
