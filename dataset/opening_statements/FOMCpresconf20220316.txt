Good afternoon . I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as aresult of Russia’ sinvasion. The human toll is tragic . The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S . economy are highly uncertain . At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability . Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point . The economy is very strong, and against the backdrop of a nextremely tight labor market and high inflation, the Committee anticipates th at ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate . In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at acoming meeting . Economic activity expanded at arobust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecti ng progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses . The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year . But cases hav edeclined sharply since mid -January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief. Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent adownside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue t oforesee solid growth. A sshown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year , 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024. The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first two unemployment rate hit apost -pandemic low of 3.8 percent, abit below the median of Committee participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level . The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued. As aresult, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years . FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and remaining near that level thereafter. Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent . Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. These supply disruptions have been larger , and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to abroader range of goods and services . Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia ’sinvasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near -term inflation here at home . We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote along expansion—and that is only possible in an environment of price stability. As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2 percen twhile the labor market remain sstron g. That said, inflation is likely to take projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3 percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher tha nprojected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside . The Fed ’smonetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employme nt and stable prices for the American people. Our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. As I noted, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate . The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this year—afull percentage point higher than projected in December . Over the following two years, the median projection is 2.8 percent —somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer -run value . Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be ayear or more from now. Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy . At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good progress on aplan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at acoming meeting . In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful o fthe broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability . As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia ’sinvasion of Ukraine for the U.S . economy are highly uncertain. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and ot her channels. The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to tighten credit conditions and affect the real economy . Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires arecognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways . We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment . We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations . The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability . The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary po licy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .
