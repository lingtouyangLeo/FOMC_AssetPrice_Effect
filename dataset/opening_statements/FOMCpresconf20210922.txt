Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. I ndicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. Real GDP rose at arobust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at astrong pace in the second half. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID -19 cases has slowed their recovery. Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year but flattened out in J uly and August as spending softened in COVID -sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. Additionally, in some industries, near -term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle indust ry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections , but As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months. In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure underst ates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 and ’ 24. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bot tlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants ’ inflation projections for this is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal . The median inflation projection from FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next yea r. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than antic ipated, posing upside risks to inflation . Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad- based and inclusive maximu m-employment goal. Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer -run inflation goal of 2 percent. If sustained higher inflation were to become aserious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus , and risks to the economic outlook remain. The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID -19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. C ontinued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support areturn to more normal economic conditions . The Fed ’spolicy actions have been guided by our manda te to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been acritical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and mark et functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the December. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals . If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that amoderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warrant ed. We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee ’sguidance. While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, agradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer -term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry adirect signal regarding the timing of in terest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated adifferent and substantially more stringent test. We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market condi tions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’sassessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year ; as aresult, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022. Participants generally expect agradual pace of policy fir ming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer -run level through 2024. Of course, these fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
