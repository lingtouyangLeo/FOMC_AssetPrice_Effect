Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has moderated. GDP rose at apace of around 1½ percent in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent last year. The moderation in growth largely reflects aslowdown in consumer spending. In contrast, business investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year ’space. Activity in the housing sector remains weak. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent next year, atouch stronger than projected in June. In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at arelatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to apace of just 29 ,000 per month over the past three months. A good part of the creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate , while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter. Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid -2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer- run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year , as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continu ing for services. Near -term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market - and survey- based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer -term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today ’smeeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet. Changes to government policies continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen. A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived —aone -time shift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is arisk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that aone -time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside —achallenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. With downside ri sks to employment having increased, the balance of risks has shifted. Accordingly, we judged it appropriate at this meeting to take another step toward amore neutral policy stance. With today’ sdecision, we remain well positioned to respond in atimely way to potential economic developments. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario for the economy. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.6 percent at the end of this year, 3.4 percent at the end of 2026, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2027. This path is ¼ percentage point lower than projected in June. As is always the case, these individual fo recasts are subject to uncertainty, and they are not a Committee plan or decision. Policy is not on apreset course. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission, and we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
