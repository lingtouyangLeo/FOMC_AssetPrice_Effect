Good afternoon , everyone . My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal . Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve asustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at abrisk pac e. We ’ve covered alot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we ’re in aposition to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at asolid pace, and, so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particul arly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent. Participants expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, astrong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the yea r. The unemployment rate ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the consumer price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3. 4 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in abroad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has along way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026. The Fed ’smonetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet th ehigher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted ea rlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage points. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’ smeeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to conti nue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We are committed to achieving and sustaining astance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. In our SEP, FOMC particip ants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely —sorry —the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median parti cipant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025. Compared with our June Summary of Economic Projections , the median projec tion is unrevised for the end of this year but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years. These projections , of course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will ad just as appropriate to foster our maximum- employment and price -stability incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflatio n, as well as the balance of risks. Given how far we have come, we are in aposition to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy. We ’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at arestrictive level until we ’re confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require aperiod of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions . Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude : We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.
